# LFS Instalation scripts

These scripts are based on the [official LFS instalation guide](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/read.html) version **11.0**.

For now, the only changes made are those necessary to automatic execution and some configuration options.

## Roadmap

1. Finish official guide
1. Make a simple package manager
1. Add more options of init system, compiler and core utils
